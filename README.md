# Drupal Headless React Demo

This is a Github package that contains the Drupal App and React App ready to be launched for testing how the Drupal Headless + React integration works with a simple React App that renders a few blog nodes pulled from the REST API Endpoint already setup in the Drupal instance.

This is a starting work, you can extend your React App to do more by exposing more Drupal REST APIs to interact from React App to do things like: pulling Drupal Bocks to be rendered in the decoupled frontend and much more !

## Installation

1. Clone your project as usual: https://github.com/danrod96/Drupal-Headless-React-Demo
